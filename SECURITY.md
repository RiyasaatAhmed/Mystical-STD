 - `2. Include:`
    - A description of the vulnerability.
    - Steps to reproduce the issue.
    - Any potential impact it may have.
    - Any possible solutions or mitigations you can suggest.
- `3. Do Not:`
  - Open a public issue on GitHub to report the vulnerability.
  
### Response Process
  - `1. Acknowledgment:` We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 72 hours and provide an initial response indicating the next steps in handling the vulnerability.
  - `2. Investigation:` We will investigate the issue thoroughly to verify its validity and determine the impact.
  - `3. Mitigation:` We will work on a fix and plan the release of a patch. This might involve collaboration with you to understand the vulnerability better and to test potential fixes.
